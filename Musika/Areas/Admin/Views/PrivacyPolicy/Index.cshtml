                            Your privacy is a serious matter to us.  Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) so that you understand how we treat your information.  This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Musika, LLC and its affiliates (“Musika” “we” “us” or “our”) with respect to your access to and use of the Services (as hereafter defined), whether as a Fan or as an Artist, through (a) our website, located at www.Musikaapp.com, www.artists.Musika.com and all corresponding websites associated and affiliated with Musika (the “Sites”) (b) Musika-branded mobile, web, tablet, desktop and other applications, including applications made available through Facebook, iOS and Android (the “Musika App(s)”) or (c) any of the Manager/Analytics Services, Content, Musika’s social networking services and any other content, applications, features, functionality, information and services offered by us whether through the Musika Apps, the Sites or otherwise (each of the above individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of information we collect and the kinds of companies with which we share such information.  Please review our Terms of Use which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the Terms of Use.<br>
                            <br>

                            This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Services or any other particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Services terminates, expires, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in any of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services or whether you are accessing the Services as a registered user (i.e., an end user with a User Account) or otherwise.<br>
                            <br>

                            This Privacy Policy governs only the information (a) collected by us from you or (b) provided to us by a Third Party Platform (e.g., Apple (iTunes, etc.), Facebook, Twitter, Last.fm, Pandora, etc.) about you, in each instance, on or in connection with your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other third party, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your personal information to third parties, including marketing companies, advertisers and service providers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

                            <br>
                            As it is used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Information” means any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify and/or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, physical address, payment card information, telephone number(s), a unique device identifier assigned to your Device (“UDID”), Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers, your Internet protocol (IP) address (if applicable), and location data (if you enable this feature).  When we use the term “Additional Information”, we mean any information that we collect about you on or in connection with the Services other than Personal Information (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to as “Information”). By accessing and/or using the Services, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.<br>
                            <br>

                            In order to access and use certain content, features and functionality of the Services, whether as a Fan or an Artist, we may require that you provide and/or make available (e.g., via third party services) to us certain Information, including information we may require you to provide when your register, and use the Services, such as when you RSVP to or purchase tickets to a concert.  Additionally, when you access the Musika App on your mobile device, the Musika App may scan the music library on that mobile device including access to music services to which you may be subscribed or are otherwise using and collects data about the contents of your music library.  Musika also collects information regarding your use of and interaction with the Services, whether or not used, operated, or accessed by or through a Third Party Platform, including Artists and concerts you are currently tracking, the total number of Fans tracking a particular Artist or event, content that you share  through such Third Party Platforms or publicly (i.e., events you are attending, profile picture, etc.), total number of RSVPs to a particular event and total number of Fans who have purchased a particular song or album.  If you limit our collection of certain Information, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services.<br>
                            <br>

                            We may ask your permission to collect location-based information from you or your Device, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based location information, longitude/latitude, etc.).  If you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device.  We may use and share that location-based information with third parties to deliver, market and promote the content, services, features and products (and/or to verify your rights to receive such content, services, features and/or products) that are available through the Services.   <br>
                            <br>

                            When you use the Services, we automatically collect certain Information, to assist us in authenticating your usage and/or Device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience. In addition, the Services and/or third parties may use “cookies” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your device), "embedded scripts", and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. <br>
                            <br>

                            As part of the Services, we may also use a variety of third parties, including advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers and marketing analytics service providers to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Services (“Third Party Advertising Providers”). Such Third Party Advertising Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited.  These Third Party Advertising Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information.  Musika does not control these Third Party Advertising Providers and/or their use of Tracking Technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Service.  Please see Section 6 below for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and use of Information collected via certain automatic collection technologies.
