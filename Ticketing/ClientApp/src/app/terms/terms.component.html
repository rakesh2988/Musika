The terms “include,” “includes,” and “including,” whether or not capitalized, mean “include, but are not limited to,” “includes, but is not limited to,” and “including, but not limited to,” respectively and are to be construed as inclusive, not exclusive. &nbsp;Any provision which must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of this Agreement; however, no action arising out of this Agreement or your use of the Services, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause arose). The failure of Musika to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

              <p>We reserve the right to terminate or deny access, use and registration privileges to any user of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without obligation to you or any third party. &nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge, consent and agree that Musika may access and disclose your account and registration information if required to do so by law or if based on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to comply with the legal process, enforce the Agreement, response to claims that any content or information violates the rights to any third party, respond to customer service requests, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of Musika, its users or third parties.</p>
              <p>To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms shall govern. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the specific Rules for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Rules shall govern.
