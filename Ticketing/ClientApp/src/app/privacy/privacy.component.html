            <p><span style="color: #333333;">Your privacy is a serious matter to us. &nbsp;Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) so that you understand how we treat your information. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use such information and with whom it may be shared, and your rights and choices with regard to controlling your information when you visit the Sites and/or use the Services (each as hereinafter defined). &nbsp;This Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected, used and disclosed by Musika LLC, and its affiliates (“Musika LLC” “we” “us” or “our”) or any third parties acting with our authorization or otherwise provided to us by third parties about you, in each instance, with respect to your access to and use of the Services, whether as a Fan, visitor, user, Venue or Artist, and whether offline or online, through (a) your interaction with our products and services, (b) our website, located at www.MusikaApp.com and all corresponding web pages and websites owned or operated by Musika LLC, (the “Sites”), (c) the Musika LLC-branded mobile, web, tablet, desktop and other applications, including applications made available through Facebook, iOS and Android (the “Musika App(s)”) or (d) any of the Manager/Analytics Services, Content, Musika’s social networking services and any other content, applications, features, functionality, information and services offered by us whether through the Musika Apps, the Sites or otherwise (each of the above individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”). &nbsp;Where you have provided your personal information to third parties, including marketing companies, advertisers and service providers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Please review our <u><a style="color: #333333;" target="_blank" href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/terms">Terms of Use</a></u> which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the <u><a style="color: #333333;" target="_blank" href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/terms">Terms of Use</a></u>.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #333333;">This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Services or any other particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Services terminates or expires or is suspended or deactivated for any reason. The collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy is based on your voluntary consent or on our contractual obligations to you or legitimate interest. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in any of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services or whether you are accessing the Services as a visitor or a registered Fan or Artist user (i.e., an end user with a User Account).</span></p>
            <h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Information We Collect About You</strong></span></h2>
            <p><span style="color: #333333;">We collect personal information or other information about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services. &nbsp;The information and data we may process (i.e. collect, use and store) depends on your interaction with us. &nbsp;When processing Information (as defined below), we will either rely on our legitimate interest or our need to perform under a contract to process your information or you will be asked affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;The key types of Information that we may process include the following:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Registration and Account Information: </strong>In order to access and use certain content, features and functionality of the Services, whether as a Fan, an Artist or a Venue, we require that you create an account and provide and/or make available (e.g., via third party services) to us certain Information such as your email address, your name, and location. In addition to these three mandatory fields, we request access to your contacts stored within your Device to help you find your friends on the Services and access to your music library on your Device to help you find the music you love. If you do not use your email to register, you may register to use our services via Facebook or Spotify connect. The Information we collect from these thirds parties during registration includes your profile picture, age range, and gender in order to generate your user profile. We also collect information on artists you follow in order to track them on the Services. In addition to these required information, we ask for secondary information in order to personalize your experience. These optional fields are date of birth, gender, and contacts. We collect only the Personal Information necessary to provide the Services and to provide you with a more customized and relevant experience. If you’d like to utilize the Services for purchasing tickets, you may then be asked to provide your credit card information. When purchasing tickets you will be pushed to a third-party website that allows you enter your credit card and billing information and complete the ticketing transaction. We do not keep or process your credit card or billing information. Once you provide us with this information mentioned above, we offer you our additional Services such as RSVPing, liking or tracking your favorite bands, using the ticket concierge, or exploring artists similar to your favorite bands, receiving alerts for concerts in your area, etc.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Location Information: </strong>In order to provide you with information about concerts or promotions in your area, we ask your permission to collect location-based information from you or your Device, including your IP address, city, country, zip code, region, radius, time zone, GPS-based location information, and longitude/latitude. Your location is used to personalize the content you see within the Services. We may also collect other information based on your location and your Device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the “beacon” and your Device and the duration that your Device is near the “beacon”. The type of location data we collect depends on a number of factors, including the type of Device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and the type of connection enabled on your Device (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, broadband cable). If you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device. We may use and share that location-based information with third parties to deliver, market and promote the content, services, features, products and advertising (and/or to verify your rights to receive such content, services, features and/or products) that are available through the Services. If you no longer wish to have this location information collected and used by us, you may “opt-out” by disabling the location and Bluetooth features in the operating system of your Device and/or in the Musika App.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Music DNA: </strong>When you create an account, we will ask to scan the music library on your device, your social media accounts, and music subscription services in order to create a unique “music DNA”, which is your digital identity based on your music tastes. We will develop and refine your music DNA based on Artists you like while using the Services, Artists’ pages you follow and events you state you are attending. We will make additional music suggestions based on your music DNA. We will also use your Music DNA to provide relevant promotional emails and other forms of advertising to you. If you limit our ability to scan your music library, social media or music services, we may not be able to offer you tailored music experiences and suggestions.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Third Party Platform Information: </strong>If you access the Services via your Third Party Platform account (e.g., by logging in to the Services using your Third Party Platform account credentials from third parties like Apple (iTunes, etc.), Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Last.fm, and Pandora) and/or integrate your Musika account with your Third Party Platform account, we may collect certain information about you from the Third Party Platform, such as your username, email address, music preferences and other information you provided to the Third Party Platform in connection with your account (name, country, date of birth, friend connections, user posts, profile picture, RSVPs, Artist and event page visits, credit card, Device ID, gender and e-mail address). We use this information to further enhance your Musika user profile and to inform your Music DNA within the Musika system. If you do not connect Musika to a Third Party Platform, or otherwise disconnect your Musika account from such Third Party Platform, that may limit our collection of certain Information about you, which may limit your ability to use certain features of the Services.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide to Obtain Additional Services: </strong>We may collect Personal Information that you choose to provide to us when you elect to participate in optional Site-features or Services. For example, if you sign up to receive newsletters, marketing promotions or other communications regarding the Services, your favorite Artists and/or third-party products or services, participate in contests, surveys and other promotions related to the Services, we may collect your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and survey responses in order to provide the additional features or Services. We will make clear what information we may process as a result of your engagement with the optional Site-features or Services.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Information Collected by Cookies: </strong>As further described in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy, when you use the Services, we automatically collect certain Information, to assist us in authenticating your usage and/or Device, keep track of your preferences, create a more tailored user experience and to provide targeted advertising. In addition, the Services and/or third parties may use “cookies” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your device), “embedded scripts”, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. Information processed by Tracking Technologies will be processed in accordance with our Cookie Policy located <u><a style="color: #333333;" target="_blank" href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/cookie-policy">here</a></u>.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Third Party Advertising: </strong>As part of the Services and in accordance with our <u><a style="color: #333333;" target="_blank" href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a></u>, we may also use a variety of third parties, including advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers and marketing analytics service providers to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, populate user-specific advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Services (“Third Party Advertising Providers”). Such Third Party Advertising Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited. These Third Party Advertising Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information. Musika does not control these Third Party Advertising Providers and/or their use of Tracking Technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Advertising Provider. Please see Section 6 of this Privacy Policy below for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and use of Information collected via certain Tracking Technologies.</span></li>

            <p><span style="color: #333333;">We maintain and have implemented security safeguards to protect the Personal Information submitted to and collected, used and stored by us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps to protect your account and Personal Information as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private, and logging out of your account when you are finished using it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #333333;">We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized. &nbsp;Musika will not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a technical malfunction or a breach in security.</span></p>

We may continue to process your Information based on our legitimate interests or in order to fulfill our obligations under a contract and/or may also seek your affirmative consent to the terms of the updated Privacy Policy. &nbsp; For example, we may ask for your consent before implementing new uses of the Personal Information that we have already collected from you based on such consent, if such new use was not addressed by the privacy policy under which such information was collected or if our legal basis for processing such information changes.</span></p>

            <p><span style="color: #333333;">It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete Information or you fail to update such Information.
